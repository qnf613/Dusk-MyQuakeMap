This archive contains information on the sky boxes that I have collected
from the net. The boxes are available for download at the following link:

http://menczel.extra.hu/q3sky.html

I hope that these sky boxes are going to be useful for mappers all around.
If you have a nice skybox (made by you or downloaded) which is not yet in
the collection, just let me know and I will include it if you wish.

The folder 'gallery' contains a representative image for each sky box in
the collection, The text file 'license.txt' contains a table in which the
sky boxes together with their license type are listed in alphabetical order.

DISCLAIMER
**********

These skyboxes have not been produced by me, I take no credit whatsoever
for them. I have collected them together for convenience and made a few
slight modifications / improvements.

LICENSING
*********

I tried to determine the licensing terms for each sky box (by checking the
accompanying READMEs and the authors' WEB sites). I have contacted some of
the authors to ascertain the license terms. The boxes are divided into the
following groups according to licenses:

ambiquous ----> no clear license terms, but probably safe to use in
                non-commercial projects
             
noncomm ------> free to use in non-commercial projects

gpl ----------> may be freely used in any project and may be distributed
                under the GNU General Public License version 2
             
unrestricted -> free to use in any way you can think of (just give proper
                credit to the author)

You can check the individual 'readme' files included in the separate
skybox archives. If in doubt, connect the original author, provided that
the e-mail is still valid which is not very likely :-(

SHADER SUPPORT
**************

Each skybox has a working Q3A shader script. Some of these scripts were made
by me because the corresponding original works did not include any. I have
checked the sun's direction & elevation values in every single skybox in the
archive and added the appropriate values to the shaders. I have not adjusted
the color and intensity of the sun, you have to do it yourself.

In a few cases it was impossible to identify an unambiquous light source (sun)
in the skybox. in these cases I left the direction/elevation values at 0/90,
you will have to set them to your preferences.

I used a simple test map for checking the sun's settings. The MAP file and
textures necessary to build this test map are in the folder 'skytest'. I also
included a text file containing instructions on how to use the map.
